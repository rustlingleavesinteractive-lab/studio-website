Captain's log, Stardate 43996.2. The Enterprise remains concealed in the dust cloud. And, to my surprise, the Borg have maintained their position waiting for us to come out of hiding. I have no explanation for their special interest in me or this ship. We continue to prepare our defenses for the inevitable confrontation but, I must admit, on this night I contemplate the possibility that no defense may be adequate against this enemy.
