Rustling Leaves Games is always excited to meet passionate, creative, and driven developers
who want to help us shape thoughtful, emotionally grounded interactive experiences. If you
don’t see an open role that fits your background, you can still apply here to be considered for
future opportunities.

We welcome applicants across a wide range of disciplines, including (but not limited to):
**Design, Narrative, Art, Animation, Programming, Audio, Production, QA, and
Community/Marketing**.

Whether you're an experienced dev or an emerging talent, we’d love to learn more about you
and how you might contribute to the worlds we create.

## How to Stand Out
- **Include a brief cover letter** telling us why you’d love to join Rustling Leaves Games and
what excites you about our projects.
- **Share your portfolio or demo reel** if you have one; while not required for every role, it
helps us understand your strengths and creative voice.
- **Keep it real**. Tell us who you are, what you care about, and the kind of work you want to
grow into.

## Our Commitment
At Rustling Leaves Games, we are a volunteer-based, non-commission studio, but that doesn’t
limit our ambition or our dedication to the people who join us. Our mission is to help every team
member grow professionally in the video game industry while contributing to meaningful,
story-driven experiences.

We aim to cultivate a studio built on passion, drive, communication, and mutual respect. Diverse
perspectives lead to richer worlds and better stories, and we are fully committed to fostering a
welcoming, inclusive, and supportive environment for everyone who becomes part of our team.

Together, we strive to create a place where creatives, developers, and storytellers can learn,
collaborate, and build something truly special.
