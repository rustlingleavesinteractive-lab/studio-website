Rustling Leaves Games is an indie studio focused on creating emotional, narrative-driven
interactive experiences. We’re a small, collaborative team building thoughtful and atmospheric
games, and we’re looking for a **Creative Engineer** to help define the mood, tone, and visual language of
our environments.

## Role Overview
As a Creative Engineer, you’ll be responsible for shaping the visual and cinematic presentation
of the game. This includes lighting, level layout/blockouts, environmental storytelling, and
working with Unreal Engine’s cinematic tools to bring scenes to life. You’ll collaborate closely
with writers, designers, and technical engineers to create immersive, emotionally resonant
spaces.

**This is a volunteer role, but we strive to create a professional, supportive, and
growth-focused environment.**

member grow professionally in the video game industry while contributing to meaningful,
story-driven experiences.

We aim to cultivate a studio built on passion, drive, communication, and mutual respect. Diverse
perspectives lead to richer worlds and better stories, and we are fully committed to fostering a
welcoming, inclusive, and supportive environment for everyone who becomes part of our team.
