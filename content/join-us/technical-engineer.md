supporting the team with technical solutions across the project. You’ll work closely with
designers, writers, and other developers to implement features such as dialog systems,

that help shape our world.

**This is a volunteer role, but we strive to create a professional, supportive, and
growth-focused environment.**

- Experience developing for consoles (Switch, PS5, Xbox Series S/X)
- Experience with **Godot** (for potential prototyping)

## Our Commitment

At Rustling Leaves Games, we are a volunteer-based, non-commission studio, but that doesn’t
limit our ambition or our dedication to the people who join us. Our mission is to help every team
member grow professionally in the video game industry while contributing to meaningful,
story-driven experiences.

We aim to cultivate a studio built on passion, drive, communication, and mutual respect. Diverse
perspectives lead to richer worlds and better stories, and we are fully committed to fostering a
welcoming, inclusive, and supportive environment for everyone who becomes part of our team.

Together, we strive to create a place where creatives, developers, and storytellers can learn,
collaborate, and build something truly special.
